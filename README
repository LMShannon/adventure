===COMPILING===
You'll need to install GHC, the glorious Glasgow Haskell Compiler.  Then just type:
% make

That's it!  The output executable will be ./adventure

===EDITING===
Everything's in a git repo, but you know that already if you're reading this :)
Hints:
git help
git status
git commit -m 'This is a FANTASTIC improvement'

The source files are in src/...  Locations.hs has most of the game data.  It's also
possible to do a fair amount with Items.hs, though you'll need to either code up
new options at various locations to _use_ the items, or add to the standard options
in StandardOptions.hs

The game engine itself is implemented in Engine.hs, and the main function is in
adventure.hs
